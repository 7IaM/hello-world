# hello-world
just another repository

Hello, My name is TJ
I'm VERY new to the IT world and I hope to do great things in the field.
I have researched Python, Java Script, and Cyber Security which have all 
very been intriguing.
So hopefully this awesome community will embrace me with open arms
as we help each other along the way!

Thanks and I can't wait to learn!
